# Compound Assignment Operators

We've already discussed the `=` operator which sets the value of a variable. There are a few more assignment operators which are mostly used for convenience. These are the compound operators : `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`. 

These operators apply their respective operation between the variable being assigned to and the value on the right and assign that value to the variable. In other words:
```
var += 2
```
can be read as 
```
var = var + 2
```

and
```
var /= 2
```
can be read as
```
var = var / 2
```

etc..
